# 📡 Ultrasonic Proximity Alert System

A servo-mounted ultrasonic scanner that detects nearby objects, displays real-time distance data on an LCD, and triggers an audible alert when an object enters a defined proximity range.

## 🔎 Overview

The **Ultrasonic Proximity Alert System** uses an ultrasonic range sensor mounted on a rotating servo to continuously scan the environment.  
When an object is detected within a configurable threshold (e.g., **0–40 cm**), the system:

- Stops the servo to “lock” onto the object
- Displays **OBJECT DETECTED** and the measured distance on a 16×2 I²C LCD
- Activates a buzzer alert
- Returns to scanning mode once the object is no longer detected
- Can be toggled ON/OFF using an external switch

This project demonstrates embedded systems concepts such as real-time sensor measurement, PWM control, hardware interrupts/polling, and state-machine-based logic.

## 💻 How the Code Works

### 1. **Initialization**
- Sets up GPIO pins, servo PWM, LCD, and switch input.
- Clears the LCD and sets up initial states.

### 2. **System ON/OFF Handling**
- If the switch is OFF → LCD shuts down, servo stops, buzzer stays OFF.
- When switched back ON, LCD re-initializes properly and scanning starts.

### 3. **Scanning Mode**
- Servo rotates from left → right, then right → left.
- At each angle step:
  - Ultrasonic sensor measures distance.
  - LCD displays “SCANNING” + distance.

### 4. **Object Detection**
- If distance ≤ threshold (e.g., 40 cm):
  - Servo freezes at its current angle.
  - LCD shows **OBJECT DETECTED** and range.
  - Buzzer beeps.
  - System waits until object is gone.

### 5. **Resume Scanning**
- After the object is out of range:
  - Buzzer turns off.
  - System returns to scanning mode.
